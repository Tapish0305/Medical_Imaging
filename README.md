  # Project Title
  Identifying medical conditions in X-ray of various thoracic regions through mordern Machine Learning(Algorithim).
  # Dataset Overview
  There are 3 dataset used in the project 1st dataset used is Vinbigdata-512-Image-Dataset 2nd one is VinBigData-YOLO-Labels-Dataset and 3rd one is 
  yolov5-official-v31-dataset. The first dataset "Vinbigdata-512-Image-Dataset" contain the train and test directory. Both of the directory contain 
  image. The second dataset "VinBigData-YOLO-Labels-Dataset" contain the train and test directory. Both of the directory contain labels. There are 
  14 medical conditions. The third dataset is official yolov5 dataset
