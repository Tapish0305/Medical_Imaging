  # Project Title
    Identifying medical conditions in X-ray of various thoracic regions through mordern Machine Learning(Algorithim).
  # Dataset Overview
 This project utilizes three datasets for training and evaluation:
 1. Vinbigdata-512-Image-Dataset-
    
     Contains train and test directories, each holding medical images.
 3. VinBigData-YOLO-Labels-Dataset-
    
     Contains train and test directories, each holding corresponding labels.
     Covers 14 medical conditions detected in chest X-rays.
 4. YOLOv5-Official-v31-Dataset-
    
     The official YOLOv5 dataset used for benchmarking and model improvements.
